# ESP8266 Bike Speedometer

**Situation:** Wanted to measure the speed of my bicycle without GPS functionality (due to potential inaccuracy).

**Process:** Calculated a conversion from revolutions per second for a 28 in. bike to miles per hour. Brainstormed and landed on magnetically operated mechanism to trigger a revolution. Tested design on a mockup bicycle and an Arduino Uno. Designed and built circuit on actual bicycle, modified code for ESP8266, and designed battery holder.

**Result:** Outputs accurate and timely results for the speed of the bicycle.
